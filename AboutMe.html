									<h2>Who am I?</h2>
										<p>My name is Danielle Hall. I grew up in the United States (due to my American father) and moved to Norway when I was 14 (due to my Norwegian-Filipino mother). Because of my interesting upbringing and cultural background, I have developed into someone who thrives when met with challenges and adversity. Learning Data Science began as a simple interest that I would delve into in my free time, but I quickly decided I wanted a career in this fascinating, ever-evolving, and challenging field.</p>

											<h3>What is my <b>Education?</b></h3>
											<p>My formal education consists of one finished degree and one degree that I am currently undertaking:
												<dl>
														<dt>Bachelor's of Science in Psychology from the University of Essex</dt>
														<dd>
															<p>While undertaking this degree, I developed great interpersonal communication skills and a deep understanding of human behavior. This is also where my love for data began, as I delved into statistics, research, and due to my thesis, (How the design of maps affected their usability) learned about usability research and user experience design.</p>
														</dd>
														<dt>Master's of Science in Data Science from the University of Essex</dt>
														<dd>
															<p>While undertaking this degree, I hope to develop the skills necessary to become a data scientist, further my understanding of the responsibilities and role of a data scientist, and use my unique perspective as a student with a psychology background to create more constructive collaborations and discussions with my peers.</p>
														</dd>
														<dt>IBM Data Science Professional Certificate</dt>
														<dd>
															<p>This course - offered by the International Business Machines Corporation - has given me the foundation to call myself a data scientist, with skills such as python, SQL, data visualization, machine learning, and more.</p>
														</dd>

											<h3>What am I doing <b>Currently?</b></h3>
											<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>With my background as a psychology graduate, I began working as a subsitute in a psychiatric ward. I started out working during the day, using environmental therapy techniques to treat the patients of the ward. When I got more experience, I was offered a longer contract as an official worker and not just an on-call subsitute - with the condition that I would only be working night shifts. That leads me to where I am today, coding this portfolio and doing school work quietly while the patients are asleep in their rooms. <br><br>In my free time, I can be found consuming concerningly large amounts of literature, playing online first person shooters, and fervently researching whatever topic I've most recently gotten obsessed with.</p>
